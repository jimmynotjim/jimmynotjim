After a nearly a year of planning and hard work, Loft 112 enjoyed it's official Open House last week. Although the gallery opened it's doors with a soft launch just in time for Christmas, last Friday's celebrations were a chance for the volunteers, artists, and gallery friends to join together for the first time.

Kim Ewoldsen, Director of the Morrison Area Development Center, kicked things off with a few words of praise and thanks for everyone involved in the making the gallery happen. Her remarks were followed by a Ribbon Cutting with the gallery's core team of volunteers--including Anne Frame, Ned Nesti, and Sandra Crouse--and a few local representatives.

Even though the night is over, the celebrations will continue. The Loft is expanding the number of artists on display and will be working with Woodlawn Academy to host art classes upstairs. Stop by on Thursdays from 10-2, or Friday and Saturday from 10-4, and keep your eye out for future events.

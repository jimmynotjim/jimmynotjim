Speakers, including former Rock Island mayor Mark Schweibert and Entrepreneur/Black Hawk College student Adriana McBride, covered topics from individual actions to national policy changes while local grassroots organizations handed out information ranging from legal issues surrounding DAPL to clean water access.

The event finished out with a speech and performance by Sage Sisters of Solidarity members Regina M. Tsosie and Larry Lockwood. Overall the rally’s organizers considered the turnout a success, further proving that climate change is as much a local issue as it is a global one.

The residents of Morrison came out on Memorial Day to support our local troops, retired and active, as they honored their fallen camrades. Lead by American Legion Post 328, the parade featured Mayor Pannier, the Morrison High School Band, local Police and Firefighters, Scouts, riders from Teh Patriot Guard, the Clinton Shriners, and a group of rodeo riders.

The parade began at American Legion Hall, snaked it's way downtown, up North Genesee Ave, and on to Memorial Park. There, the Band performed the National Anthem, followed by Jim Prombo, Chief Petty Officer Jerry Brearton, and Pastor Mark Winkelman addressed the crowd on the history and signifigance of Memorial Day. The event was capped off with taps and a twenty-one gun salute followed by a get together at the Hall.

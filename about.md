You were expecting some boring old about page right? I'd say something like my name is Jimmy and how nice it is to meet you. Except we're not meeting, this is a one way conversation. Here I am setting type to a screen and there you are reading it. It's like trying to communicate through one of those glass walls you see in TV prisons. Scratch that, at least then we could see each other and there'd be an old corded phone to talk through.

Anyway, this is the opposite of a boring about page. I mean, you've already read a third of it and so far, it seems like you're pretty entertained. I don't know for sure, just a hunch. I mean, I'd be entertained, and I'd like to think we have a lot in common, so I'm willing to bet you are too. Shoot, where was I?

Oh right, about me? I'm just your every day carpenter, turned designer, turned developer, turned photographer. Not very exciting, oh, except maybe those years as a firefighter and EMT, those were a bit of a rush. What I'm trying to say is I've had a lot of experience in many fields, and I tend to bring those different perspectives to the table.

Ok, the boring stuff, you knew it had to come. I'm currently a Technology and Information Fellow with the CFPB (it's that new US Federal Agency looking out for American consumers). My day to day is spent building our consumer facing website and the internal tools that drive it, but I also moonlight as a photographer and production assistant with our internal media team.

I'm always looking for fun or interesting people or projects, if you'd like to get in touch, fill out the form bellow. Or if you prefer, email me at ___.

If you read this far, congrats, I can't believe you got through the bit about the dinosaur.

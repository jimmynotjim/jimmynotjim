It's been over two years since I introduced this site, and made some bold claims about about what I'd be doing in 2015. Sadly, this site, and the writing that came with it, did not end up being on that list. I continued to write here and there, but never got around to hitting publish.

There are lots of reasons why, some of it was attention, some was starting a new job, a bit was dissatisfaction, but I think most of it was simply being overwhelmed. I took on too much, in too short amount of time, and ended up fizzling out as a result.

That's ok though. I said I succeed at 40% of my goals, keeping this site updated and writing new posts just happened to fall into the other 60%. I also said how I've gotten better at letting go, and in the time since, I've become even better at it.

At some point, I decided family needed to come absolutely first. For a long time my family time took a back seat to development time. Not just developing code, but developing a whole new persona, one that was engaged in tech.
